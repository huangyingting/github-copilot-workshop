- Basic understanding of Markdown

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-copilot-workshop.git
   cd github-copilot-workshop
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/huangyingting/github-copilot-workshop.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies** (for testing Python tools):
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Documentation Contributions

When contributing to documentation:

1. **Follow the existing structure**: Maintain the module-based organization
2. **Use clear headings**: Make content scannable with proper heading levels
3. **Include examples**: Add code snippets and command examples
4. **Add visuals**: Include screenshots, diagrams, or Mermaid charts when helpful
5. **Test all instructions**: Verify that all steps and examples work
6. **Keep it accessible**: Write for beginners while providing depth for advanced users

### Code Contributions

When contributing code examples or tools:

1. **Follow Python best practices**: Use PEP 8 style guide
2. **Add type hints**: Include type annotations for functions
3. **Write docstrings**: Document all public functions and classes
4. **Include comments**: Explain complex logic or Copilot-specific features
5. **Add error handling**: Handle edge cases gracefully
6. **Write tests**: Add unit tests for new functionality (if applicable)
7. **Keep it simple**: Prioritize readability over cleverness

### Custom Instructions and Prompts

When adding custom instructions, prompts, or chat modes:

1. **Focus on a specific domain**: Address a clear, well-defined use case
2. **Include metadata**: Add YAML frontmatter with description and mode
3. **Provide examples**: Show how to use the instruction/prompt
4. **Document tools needed**: Specify any required tools or dependencies
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify it works as expected with Copilot
6. **Follow naming conventions**: Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames

### Exercise Contributions

When adding hands-on exercises:

1. **Define clear objectives**: State what participants will learn
2. **List prerequisites**: Specify required tools and knowledge
3. **Provide step-by-step instructions**: Make exercises easy to follow
4. **Include verification steps**: Help participants confirm success
5. **Add troubleshooting tips**: Address common issues
6. **Consider difficulty levels**: Label as beginner, intermediate, or advanced

## Style Guides

### Markdown Style

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Use relative links for internal references
- Use reference-style links for external URLs
- One sentence per line for easier diffs
- Leave blank line before and after headings, lists, and code blocks

### Code Style

**Python**:
```python
def example_function(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> dict:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    result = {"key": "value"}
    return result
```

**Bash/Shell**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script description
set -euo pipefail

# Use long-form flags for readability
command --verbose --output file.txt
```

### Commit Message Style

Follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
